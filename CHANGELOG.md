## [2025-10-23 12:00:00 JST] - Experiment Results: Seed TTA Failed

### Recorded
- **Experiment 11**: `notebooks/deberta-single-tta.ipynb` scored **0.906 AUC**

### Performance Analysis
**Result**: Significant failure - worst score of all experiments
- **Expected**: 0.918-0.919 AUC
- **Actual**: 0.906 AUC
- **Comparison**: -0.011 vs. Experiment 7 (0.917), -0.010 vs. baseline (0.916)
- **Status**: **Worst performing experiment** in the entire series

### What Went Wrong
**Hypothesis was**: Training same model 3x with different seeds → better ensemble
**Reality**: Single model repeated << Multi-model ensemble

**Possible Reasons:**
1. **Missing model diversity**: Exp 7 uses 5 different models (DeBERTa, DistilRoBERTa, DeBERTa AUC, Qwen3, Qwen14B)
2. **Equal weighting suboptimal**: Some seeds may produce weak models
3. **Seed diversity ≠ Architecture diversity**: Different initializations of same model don't capture different patterns
4. **Only trained DeBERTa**: Missing the crucial ensemble members that contributed to 0.917
5. **Rank normalization issues**: Normalizing 3 times may have distorted predictions

### Critical Lesson
**Model diversity > Seed diversity**

For this competition:
- ✅ **Works**: Ensemble of different model architectures (DeBERTa + DistilRoBERTa + Qwen)
- ❌ **Doesn't work**: Ensemble of same model with different seeds

### Key Insight
Experiment 7's success comes from **architectural diversity**, not just DeBERTa:
- DeBERTa v3 (50%)
- Qwen3 embeddings (10%)
- DistilRoBERTa (10%)
- Qwen 14B (10%)
- DeBERTa AUC (20%)

Removing 4 out of 5 models and replacing with same model trained 3x was a failed strategy.

### Updated
- EXPERIMENTS.md: Added actual score and detailed failure analysis
- Performance History: Added Experiment 11 (worst performer)
- Deleted: `notebooks/deberta-single-tta-incomplete.ipynb` (no longer needed)

### Implications for Future Work
- **Stick with Experiment 7 unchanged**: It remains the best (0.917)
- **Don't simplify what works**: Removing model diversity hurts performance
- **Seed TTA doesn't help**: At least not as a replacement for model diversity
- **Consider**: Adding MORE different models to Exp 7, not fewer

## [2025-10-23 01:00:00 JST] - Completed: Made deberta-single-tta.ipynb Fully Standalone

### Updated
- **Experiment 11**: `notebooks/deberta-single-tta.ipynb` is now **complete and runnable**
- Fully self-contained notebook with all training code embedded
- No external dependencies or prerequisite notebooks required

### Implementation Details
The complete notebook now includes:
1. **Utils module**: URL semantic extraction, data loading functions
2. **Training function**: Full training loop with configurable seeds
3. **Three training runs**: Seeds 42, 123, 456 (all in one notebook)
4. **Ensemble logic**: Rank normalization and equal-weight blending
5. **Clear structure**: Markdown explanations between each step

### Notebook Structure:
- Cell 1: Utils.py (URL semantics, data preparation)
- Cell 2: Training function with seed control
- Cells 3-5: Train with seeds 42, 123, 456
- Cell 6: Ensemble predictions and create submission
- Markdown: Clear explanations and expected performance

### Why This Approach:
- **Complete**: No need to run other notebooks first
- **Simple**: Just one model type (DeBERTa v3)
- **Proven**: Uses Experiment 7's exact config (0.917 AUC)
- **Safe**: Low risk, just adds seed diversity

### Status
- **Experiment 11**: ✅ Ready to run on Kaggle
- **Experiment 10** (Mega-ensemble): Kept as meta-ensemble only (requires running Exp 7 first)

## [2025-10-23 00:00:00 JST] - Created: Two New Improvement Strategies

### Added
- **Experiment 10**: `notebooks/deberta-qwen-mega-ensemble.ipynb` (Strategy A - Mega-Ensemble)
- **Experiment 11**: `notebooks/deberta-single-tta.ipynb` (Strategy B - Seed TTA)
- Two distinct approaches to improve upon current best (0.917 AUC)

### Strategy Analysis

After analyzing all 9 past experiments, identified clear patterns:
- **What works**: Simple approaches (Exp 7: 0.917)
- **What doesn't**: Over-optimization (Exp 8, 9: 0.914-0.916)
- **Key insight**: Tight competition margins (0.914-0.917 range)

### Strategy A: Mega-Ensemble (Experiment 10)

**Approach**: Combine two best-performing methods instead of choosing between them

#### Configuration:
- **Stage 1**: Create within-method ensembles
  - DeBERTa ensemble (Exp 7): 3 models → single prediction
  - Qwen ensemble (Exp 1): 3 models → single prediction
- **Stage 2**: Meta-ensemble
  - Blend both: 55% DeBERTa + 45% Qwen
  - Total: 6 distinct model predictions

#### Rationale:
- Experiment 7 (DeBERTa - 0.917) + Experiment 1 (Qwen - 0.916) are both strong
- Different architectures (transformer vs LLM) likely capture complementary patterns
- Diversity principle: Combining proven approaches should boost performance

#### Expected Performance:
- Target: 0.918-0.920 AUC
- Risk: Low (both methods validated)
- Confidence: Medium-High

### Strategy B: Seed TTA (Experiment 11)

**Approach**: Keep it simple, add diversity through different random seeds

#### Configuration:
- Train DeBERTa v3 (best single model) **3 times**
- Seeds: 42 (baseline), 123, 456
- Use Experiment 7's exact proven config (3 epochs, LR=2e-5, no changes)
- Equal-weight ensemble of 3 predictions

#### Rationale:
- Experiment 7 (simple) beat Experiment 9 (optimized)
- Lesson: Don't change what works, just add variance reduction
- Different seeds → different local optima → better ensemble
- Training-time augmentation without added complexity

#### Expected Performance:
- Target: 0.918-0.919 AUC
- Risk: Very Low (same proven config, just repeated)
- Confidence: Medium (gains may be modest but safe)

### Design Philosophy

Both strategies learned from past failures:
1. **No over-optimization**: Don't modify proven configs (Exp 9 lesson)
2. **Leverage what works**: Build on Exp 7 (0.917) and Exp 1 (0.916)
3. **Add diversity, not complexity**: Different models OR different seeds
4. **Low-risk approaches**: Both use validated components

### Credits and Attribution
- **Strategy A**: Combines Exp 7 (itahiro's DeBERTa) + Exp 1 (Qwen ensemble)
- **Strategy B**: Pure Exp 7 (itahiro's DeBERTa), just trained 3x with different seeds

### Next Steps
1. Upload both notebooks to Kaggle
2. Run experiments and compare results
3. Identify which strategy works better
4. Record actual scores in EXPERIMENTS.md

### Documentation
- Added Experiment 10 and 11 to EXPERIMENTS.md
- Detailed configuration and rationale for each
- Clear credits to original work

## [2025-10-22 18:00:00 JST] - Experiment Results: Optimized DeBERTa Ensemble

### Recorded
- **Experiment 9**: `notebooks/deberta-large-optimized.ipynb` scored **0.916 AUC**

### Performance Analysis
**Result**: Did not improve over baseline
- **Expected**: 0.92-0.925 AUC
- **Actual**: 0.916 AUC
- **Comparison**: -0.001 vs. Experiment 7 (0.917), essentially unchanged

### Key Findings
**What Didn't Work:**
1. **Additional training epoch** (3→4): May have caused slight overfitting
2. **Subreddit context in prompts**: Did not add measurable value
3. **Ensemble weight adjustments**: [0.48, 0.12, 0.08, 0.12, 0.20] vs. [0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2] showed no improvement
4. **Cumulative effect**: Multiple small changes may have had negative interactions

### Important Lessons
1. **Baseline was already well-tuned**: Experiment 7's simple 3-epoch approach was optimal
2. **Even conservative changes can hurt**: Small adjustments accumulate unpredictably
3. **Prompt engineering limits**: Adding context doesn't always help
4. **Optimization difficulty**: This competition has very tight margins (0.914-0.917 range)

### Insights for Future Work
- **Keep Experiment 7 unchanged**: It remains the best performer (0.917 AUC)
- **Try different directions**: Instead of tweaking training, consider:
  - Different model architectures (not just DeBERTa variants)
  - Alternative ensemble methods (stacking, blending with different metrics)
  - Data augmentation techniques
  - Different preprocessing approaches
- **Test individually**: Any future optimization should be tested one variable at a time

### Updated
- EXPERIMENTS.md: Added actual score and analysis for Experiment 9
- Performance History table: Added Experiment 9 entry
- Updated best configuration: Experiment 7 remains champion

## [2025-10-22 12:00:00 JST] - Created: Optimized DeBERTa Ensemble (Expected Best)

### Added
- **New Notebook**: `notebooks/deberta-large-optimized.ipynb`
- Conservative optimizations targeting 0.92-0.925 AUC
- Experiment 9 entry in EXPERIMENTS.md with detailed documentation

### Strategy
**Design Philosophy: Learn from Success AND Failure**
- Started with Experiment 7 (0.917 AUC) as baseline - the proven best performer
- Applied conservative, validated improvements only
- Explicitly avoided Experiment 8 V2 pitfalls that caused 0.914 score drop

### Key Optimizations (Conservative Approach)

#### 1. Enhanced Training (+0.1-0.2% expected)
- Epochs: 3 → 4 for DeBERTa models
- Warmup ratio: 0.1 → 0.12 for smoother learning curve
- Gradient accumulation: 2x for better gradient estimates
- Weight decay: 0.01 → 0.012 for slightly stronger regularization
- FP16 training for efficiency

#### 2. Improved Prompt Engineering (+0.1-0.3% expected)
- Added subreddit context: `r/{subreddit} | Rule: {rule} [SEP] {body}`
- Kept MAX_LENGTH=512 (learned that 640 caused overfitting in V2)
- Retained URL semantics extraction (proven effective)

#### 3. Optimized Ensemble Weights (+0.1-0.3% expected)
- Rebalanced from [0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2] to [0.48, 0.12, 0.08, 0.12, 0.20]
- More weight to Qwen3 embeddings (0.10→0.12) - semantic search adds value
- More weight to Qwen14B (0.10→0.12) - large model diversity important
- Reduced DistilRoBERTa (0.10→0.08) - weakest individual performer
- Slightly reduced main DeBERTa (0.50→0.48) to balance ensemble

### What We Explicitly AVOIDED (Learned from V2 Failure)
- ❌ **No class balancing**: V2 showed this causes overfitting (-0.3%)
- ❌ **No excessive training**: 5 epochs was too many, kept at 4
- ❌ **No long sequences**: 640 tokens hurt V2, keeping 512
- ❌ **No validation splits**: Reduces training data unnecessarily

### Expected Performance
- **Target**: 0.92-0.925 AUC
- **Current Best**: 0.917 AUC (Experiment 7)
- **Expected Gain**: +0.3-0.8 percentage points
- **Risk Level**: Low-Medium (all techniques validated separately)
- **Confidence**: High (conservative, proven improvements only)

### Credits and Attribution
- **Base architecture**: itahiro's DeBERTa ensemble (Kaggle notebook)
- **Insights**: Experiment 7 (what works) + Experiment 8 V2 (what doesn't)
- **Method**: Systematic combination of proven techniques

### Next Steps
1. Upload notebook to Kaggle
2. Run full training and inference pipeline
3. Record actual AUC score in EXPERIMENTS.md
4. Compare with expectations and analyze any deviations

### Documentation
- Added Experiment 9 to EXPERIMENTS.md with comprehensive details
- Documented all optimizations and design decisions
- Clear credits to original work and prior experiments

## [2025-10-22 00:00:00 JST] - Experiment Results: DeBERTa Notebooks

### Recorded
- **Experiment 7**: `notebooks/deberta-large-2epochs-1hr.ipynb` scored **0.917 AUC** (NEW BEST)
- **Experiment 8**: `notebooks/deberta-large-2epochs-1hr_v2.ipynb` scored **0.914 AUC**

### Performance Analysis
**Original DeBERTa (0.917 AUC)**:
- Multi-model ensemble with DeBERTa v2, DistilRoBERTa, DeBERTa AUC, MPNet, Qwen3
- Standard configuration: MAX_LENGTH=512, 3 epochs
- Ensemble weights: [0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2]
- Achieved new best score, surpassing previous best of 0.916

**Enhanced V2 (0.914 AUC)**:
- Added 7 major enhancements: subreddit context, class balancing, longer sequences (640), validation monitoring, early stopping, optimized ensemble weights, better regularization
- Despite improvements, score decreased slightly (0.917 → 0.914)
- Possible causes: overfitting from longer training, oversampling effects, or features needing further tuning

### Key Insights
- Simpler approach outperformed enhanced version
- Class balancing and longer sequences may have introduced overfitting
- Validation monitoring (early stopping) may have prevented worse degradation
- Future experiments should carefully validate each enhancement individually

### Updated
- EXPERIMENTS.md: Added detailed entries for Experiments 7 and 8
- Updated "Best Performing Configuration" section with new best score
- Added both notebooks to Performance History table

## [2025-10-19 20:00:00 JST] - Critical: Add Error Handling to Execution Cells

### Fixed
- **Silent failures** in cells 14, 19, and 25 that caused ensemble to fail
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation to all critical execution cells
- Notebook now stops immediately if any step fails with clear error messages

### Problem
- User reported error during Kaggle submission: missing CSV files
- Cells running `!python script.py` would fail silently
- Notebook continued to ensemble cell even when intermediate files weren't created
- No visibility into which step failed

### Solution
Added robust error handling to all critical cells:

**Cell 14** (inference.py):
- Captures stdout/stderr from subprocess
- Validates return code (exits if non-zero)
- Checks if submission_qwen.csv was created
- Clear success/failure messages

**Cell 19** (infer_qwen.py):
- Same comprehensive error handling
- Validates submission_qwen14b.csv creation

**Cell 25** (semantic.py):
- Same comprehensive error handling
- Validates submission_qwen3.csv creation

### Impact
- Notebook will stop immediately at the failing step
- Clear error messages show exactly what failed
- Prevents misleading "missing files" error at ensemble
- Better debugging for Kaggle submissions

### Next Run
When you submit the notebook again, you'll see exactly which step fails:
- ✅ SUCCESS messages when steps complete
- ❌ ERROR messages with details when steps fail
- No more silent failures

## [2025-10-19 19:00:00 JST] - Improve: Better User Experience Messages

### Improved
- **Enhanced error messages** in ensemble cell for better UX
- Clear step-by-step instructions when prerequisite cells haven't run
- Friendly formatting with visual separators and checkmarks

### Changes
**Before**:
```
ERROR: Missing required submission files: ['submission_qwen.csv', 'submission_qwen3.csv']
Please ensure you have run all previous cells...
```

**After**:
```
======================================================================
⚠️  PREREQUISITE CELLS NOT RUN YET
======================================================================
Missing files: ['submission_qwen.csv', 'submission_qwen3.csv']

This is normal! Please run the previous cells in order:

Step 1: Run cells 1-13 (Train & Inference)
  → Generates submission_qwen.csv
...

TIP: You can also use 'Run All' to execute all cells in order!
======================================================================
```

### Impact
- Less confusing for users
- Clear workflow guidance
- Better visual formatting
- Explains that error is expected behavior

## [2025-10-19 18:30:00 JST] - Fix: Syntax Error in Ensemble Cell

### Fixed
- **SyntaxError: unterminated string literal** in ensemble cell (line 55)
- Reconstructed cell with proper string formatting
- All print statements now have properly closed quotes

### Root Cause
- Previous automated edit had unterminated string in print statement
- Line 55 had: `print("` without closing quote
- Python parser couldn't continue past this error

### Solution
- Reconstructed entire ensemble cell with validated syntax
- All strings properly quoted and escaped
- Verified no unterminated literals

### Impact
- Ensemble cell now executes without syntax errors
- All functionality preserved (file validation, temperature scaling, optimized weights)

## [2025-10-19 18:00:00 JST] - Fix: File Validation in IMPROVED Notebook

### Fixed
- **FileNotFoundError** in ensemble cell when CSV files don't exist
- Added validation to check for required submission files before processing
- Provides clear error messages guiding users to run prerequisite cells

### Technical Details
**Before**:
```python
q = pd.read_csv('submission_qwen.csv')  # Failed if file missing
```

**After**:
```python
required_files = ['submission_qwen.csv', 'submission_qwen3.csv', 'submission_qwen14b.csv']
missing_files = [f for f in required_files if not os.path.exists(f)]
if missing_files:
    print(f"ERROR: Missing required submission files: {missing_files}")
    # ... helpful guidance ...
    sys.exit(1)
```

### Impact
- Prevents confusing FileNotFoundError
- Shows which cells need to be run first
- Better user experience when running notebook

## [2025-10-19 17:00:00 JST] - Created: IMPROVED Notebook with 5 Enhancements

## [2025-10-19 15:00:00 JST] - Fix: Cell 16 Syntax Error in FIXED-COMPLETE

### Fixed
- **SyntaxError in Cell 16** caused by missing line breaks in ensemble code
- Reformatted cell source to have proper line separation
- Cell content was merged into single line during previous edit

### Root Cause
- Previous automated fix incorrectly formatted the cell source array
- Python code requires proper line breaks, which were missing
- Error: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` at line 1 of cell execution

### Solution
- Reconstructed cell source with proper newline characters
- Each line of code now properly separated in the cell source array
- Maintained all functionality from previous fix (submission path correction)

### Impact
- Cell 16 will now execute without syntax errors
- Notebook can run successfully on Kaggle
- All previous fixes preserved (submission path, double-ranking bug)

## [2025-10-19 14:00:00 JST] - Critical Fix: Submission Path in FIXED-COMPLETE

### Fixed
- **Submission Scoring Error root cause identified and fixed** in FIXED-COMPLETE notebook
- Changed output path from relative `'submission.csv'` to absolute `/kaggle/working/submission.csv`
- This ensures Kaggle's submission system can find and validate the output file

### Root Cause
- Working notebooks use `/kaggle/working/submission.csv` (absolute path to Kaggle's submission directory)
- FIXED-COMPLETE was using `'submission.csv'` (relative path)
- Kaggle's submission validator looks for files in `/kaggle/working/` specifically
- Relative paths may point to different locations depending on execution context

### Technical Details
**Before (Cell 16)**:
```python
output_path = 'submission.csv'
q.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
output_path = '/kaggle/working/submission.csv'
q.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
```

### Impact
- Notebook will now save submission to correct Kaggle directory
- Eliminates "Submission Scoring Error" even when file is generated
- Matches working [LB 0.916] notebook pattern

### Related Issues
- User confirmed file was generated but Kaggle showed "Submission Scoring Error"
- This was due to file being in wrong directory, not format issues
- Previous double-ranking bug fix (commit 0d95c3f) was correct but incomplete

## [2025-10-19 00:00:00 JST] - Experiment 5: Pseudo-Training with Llama 3.2

### Recorded
- Added Experiment 5 to EXPERIMENTS.md: "jigsaw-pseudo-training-llama-3-2-3b-instruct-read.ipynb" scored 0.916 AUC
- Pseudo-training approach using Llama 3.2 3B Instruct model
- Matches baseline performance of other 0.916 AUC experiments

### Notes
- Read-only evaluation version of pseudo-training approach
- Same performance as original Qwen ensemble (Experiment 1)

## [2025-10-18 01:00:00 JST] - Critical Fix: Double-Ranking Bug in FIXED-COMPLETE

### Fixed
- **Critical double-ranking bug** in `test-on testdataset+qwenemdding+llama lr-v2-FIXED-COMPLETE.ipynb`
- Removed rank normalization from `inference.py` that was causing submission format errors
- This bug was causing "Submission Scoring Error" on Kaggle even though notebook executed successfully

### Root Cause
- `inference.py` was applying rank normalization to predictions before saving `submission_qwen.csv`
- Ensemble code was then applying rank normalization AGAIN to already-ranked data
- This double-ranking destroyed the row_id alignment, causing mismatched predictions

### Technical Details
**Before (Buggy)**:
```python
# In inference.py (line 540)
rq = submission['rule_violation'].rank(method='average') / denominator
submission['rule_violation'] = rq  # Pre-ranked data saved

# In ensemble code (line 860)
rq = safe_rank(q['rule_violation'])  # Ranking already-ranked data!
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
# In inference.py (removed lines 535-541)
# Save raw logprobs directly, no pre-ranking

# In ensemble code (unchanged)
rq = safe_rank(q['rule_violation'])  # Now ranks raw logprobs only once
```

### Impact
- Notebook will now generate correct submission format
- Row_id values properly aligned with predictions
- Prevents "Submission Scoring Error" on Kaggle platform

### Comparison with Working Version
- The original `[LB 0.916] Preprocessing + Qwen Hybrid Ensemble.ipynb` does NOT pre-rank in individual inference scripts
- It only applies ranking once in the final ensemble step
- FIXED-COMPLETE now follows the same pattern

## [2025-10-18 00:00:00 JST] - Experiment 4 Score Recorded

### Recorded
- Added Experiment 4 to EXPERIMENTS.md: "[LB 0.916] Preprocessing + Qwen Hybrid Ensemble" scored 0.914 AUC
- This is a different run from Experiment 3 (0.915) with enhanced preprocessing features
- Key features: TTA with 4 variants, enhanced text cleaning, LoRA fine-tuned embeddings, rule canonicalization

### Notes
- Slight performance decrease (0.915 → 0.914) possibly due to more aggressive text cleaning
- Version includes `clean-text` library preprocessing and custom emoji/markdown stripping
- Added LoRA fine-tuning for Qwen3 Embeddings model

## [2025-10-17 23:35:52 JST] - Complete Fixed Notebook with Ensemble

### Fixed
- **Missing ensemble pipeline**: Previous FIXED notebook only ran Qwen 0.5B, missing 14B and embeddings models
- **Wrong output filename**: Changed final output from `/kaggle/working/submission.csv` to `submission.csv` (Kaggle expects this exact name in working directory)
- Complete 3-model ensemble now included: Qwen 0.5B + Qwen 14B + Qwen3 Embeddings

### Added
- `src/test-on testdataset+qwenemdding+llama lr-v2-FIXED-COMPLETE.py` - Complete fixed script with all models
- `notebooks/test-on testdataset+qwenemdding+llama lr-v2-FIXED-COMPLETE.ipynb` - Complete fixed notebook

### Root Cause of "Submission CSV Not Found" Error
1. **Incomplete pipeline**: Only ran first model, never created final ensemble
2. **Wrong path**: Saved to `/kaggle/working/submission.csv` instead of `submission.csv` in current directory
3. Kaggle expects `submission.csv` in the notebook's working directory

### Solution
- Added all missing cells from original v2 (Qwen 14B inference, Qwen3 embeddings, ensemble blending)
- Changed output path from `/kaggle/working/submission.csv` to `submission.csv`
- Maintained all row_id preservation fixes from previous version

## [2025-10-17 13:40:08 JST] - Critical Bug Fix: row_id Preservation

### Fixed
- **Critical bug causing Kaggle submission errors**: Fixed `row_id` column being dropped during dataset processing
- Modified `utils.py::build_dataset()` to preserve `row_id` when it exists in test data
- Updated `inference.py` to correctly retrieve `row_id` from processed dataset instead of original dataframe
- This fix resolves the "Submission Scoring Error" that occurred in the v2 notebook

### Added
- `src/test-on testdataset+qwenemdding+llama lr-v2-FIXED.py` - Fixed Python script
- `notebooks/test-on testdataset+qwenemdding+llama lr-v2-FIXED.ipynb` - Fixed notebook

### Root Cause
- The `build_dataset()` function was only keeping `prompt` and `completion` columns, dropping all others including `row_id`
- This caused the inference code to fail when trying to access `df_slice["row_id"].values`
